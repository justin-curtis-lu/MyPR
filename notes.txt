Front End: CSS
Back End: Elastic Search + Twilio Send Grid (Replace FlaskMail)


Error checking on post title and body size

Elastic Search on deployment only working for posts created after integration -> do a hard reset on final production

Expand on post page + seperate posting page from showing posts (ie: make_post.html) and route to posts on successful post
