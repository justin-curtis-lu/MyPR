When allowing users to upload content, going to need to use WTForms with file uploading
Need to make sure uploads are validated -> expected size, and valid file format
Consider S3 Bucket for file storing

Change from SQLalchemy to server side Db for production

Bootstrap for CSS styling


Create email account for password resetting


Reading images from filesystem, for deployment read from S3 bucket

Please log in to access this page rendering incorrectly -> consider having contact as a pop up using js

functionality for displaying all followers -> probably have to use pagination if want to consider
either a modal or new html page that just list clickable links to all users

multiple images, videos, gifs

secure hashing of img name

rely less on dependency of wtforms


user images dont show for user html but show for index html
